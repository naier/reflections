When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    
    A remote repository is useful when we are using multiple computers to manager our work.
    It is also useful when multiple team members are collaborating on a project.
    An added benefit of a remote repository is that it is a better way of backing up our work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	If Git automatically pulls changes from the remote repository, we risk losing any changes
	we made in our local files after we last pushed them to the remote repository. Doing
	this manually gives us better control of resolving any conflicts that might arise
	between the local changes and the new changes in the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use 
one instead of another?

	Fork creates a copy of another repository on GitHub - it's like cloning, except it's
	performed on the remote repository. Clone creates a copy of a remote repository in a
	local repository. It can also create a copy of another local repository. Branches are
	created whenever a separate code stream becomes necessary - for example, experimenting
	on a new feature that's not ready for production yet.
