What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Inititalizing a repository is the first step to convert a regular directory
	into a git repository. It creates the hidden .git file which stores the 
	metadata containing the history of each commit. Once this file is created,
	we can proceed with our first commit. Note that git does not automatically 
	create the first commit when you initialize the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	
	The staging area is an intermediate area between the working directory and
	the repository. It holds the files that you would like to commit from your
	directory. We can remove files from the staging area if we do not wish to
	commit them (or if they were added accidentaly).

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
